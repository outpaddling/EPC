EPC
===

EPC, Educational Personal Computer Simulator, is a simulator for use with
PLASM (Portable Assembler) and PAPP (Portable Assembly-language Preprocessor)
for use in computer architecture and assembly language programming courses.

The CPU architecture is designed to be very orthogonal and rich in addressing
modes so that it is easy to learn and program, while providing experience
with many features common to commercial architectures.

The simulator also provides feedback on program quality in the form of
total clock cycles and instruction cycles used to help students learn to
optimize for execution path.

See the included DocBook documentation for details.
